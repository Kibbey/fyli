# Fyli (Cimplur) — Product Features & Capabilities

A private memory preservation and family collaboration platform that helps busy parents capture, organize, and share life's meaningful moments with the people who matter most.

---

## Core Value Proposition

Fyli enables families to **protect and preserve meaningful moments** through private, controlled sharing. Unlike social media, Fyli is designed for intimate family circles — giving users full control over who sees what, with tools that make memory capture effortless and organized.

Note P0, P1, etc are used to indicate priority. P0 is highest.

## Key Features

### 1. Memory Stream (Drops) - P0

The central experience — a chronological feed of memories (called "drops") that users create and share.
#### P0 Core Experience
- **Create memories** with rich text descriptions and dates
- **Attach photos and videos** with automatic orientation correction and thumbnail generation
- **Infinite scroll** for seamless browsing
#### P2
- **Filter by people, albums, dates, or time periods** to find specific moments
- **Look Back** — view memories from a specific day/month across all years (e.g., every Christmas, every birthday)
- **Chronological toggle** — view oldest-first or newest-first
- **Year filtering** — browse memories from a specific year


**User benefit:** Capture moments quickly before they fade, and rediscover them easily later.

---

### 2. Storylines (Timelines) - P2

Organize memories into curated timelines about specific people you care about — a child's growth, a parent's life story, a friendship.

- **Create storylines** with name and description
- **Favorite storylines** for quick access
- **Add/remove memories** to build a narrative over time
- **Follow storylines** shared by connections
- **Guided prompts** — attach questions to storylines to inspire new memories

A guided system to help users (and their connections) recall and document memories they might otherwise forget.

### 5. Connections & Sharing - P0 

A private, invitation-only network for sharing memories with family and close friends.

Fine-grained control over who sees each memory.
